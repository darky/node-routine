In fact the cause was embarrassingly stupid.\u003cp\u003eOn a comment thread, a new user had posted some replies as siblings\ninstead of children.  I posted a comment explaining how HN worked.\nBut then I decided to just fix it for him by doing some surgery in\nthe repl.  Unfortunately I used the wrong id for one of the comments\nand created a loop in the comment tree; I caused an item to be its\nown grandchild.  After which, when anyone tried to view the thread,\nthe server would try to generate an infinitely long page.  The\nstory in question was on the frontpage, so this happened a lot.\u003cp\u003eFor some reason I didn't check the comments after the surgery to\nsee if they were in the right place. I must have been distracted\nby something.  So I didn't notice anything was wrong till a bit\nlater when the server seemed to be swamped.\u003cp\u003eWhen I tailed the logs to see what was going on, the pattern looked\na lot like what happens when HN runs short of memory and starts\nGCing too much.  Whether it was that or something else, such problems\ncan usually be fixed by restarting HN.  So that's what I did.  But\nfirst, since I had been writing code that day, I pushed the latest\nversion to the server.  As long as I was going to have to restart\nHN, I might as well get a fresh version.\u003cp\u003eAfter I restarted HN, the problem was still there.  So I guessed\nthe problem must be due to something in the code I'd written that\nday, and tried reverting to the previous version, and restarting the\nserver again.  But the problem was still there.  Then we (because\nby this point I'd managed to get hold of Nick Sivo, YC's hacker in\nresidence) tried reverting to the version of HN that was on the old\nserver, and that didn't work either.  We knew that code had worked\nfine, so we figured the problem must be with the new server.  So\nwe tried to switch back to the old server.  I don't know if Nick\nsucceeded, because in the middle of this I gave up and went to bed.\u003cp\u003eWhen I woke up this morning, Rtm had HN running on the new server.\nThe bad thread was still there, but it had been pushed off the\nfrontpage by newer stuff.  So HN as a whole wasn't dying, but there\nwere still signs something was amiss, e.g.  that /threads?id=pg\ndidn't work, because of the comment I made on the thread with the\nloop in it.\u003cp\u003eEventually Rtm noticed that the problem seemed to be related to a\ncertain item id.  When I looked at the item on disk I realized what\nmust have happened.\u003cp\u003eSo I did some more surgery in the repl, this time more carefully,\nand everything seems fine now.\u003cp\u003eSorry about that.",
